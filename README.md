# OneCorpSec
Automated Corporate Secretary System written in Django. 

System manages a database of companies, each with their individual deadlines for documents and forms and sends periodic reminder E-Mails to the person in charge. 

A simple and easy to use web admin front-end is available to manage this database of companies. Initialization and batch updating of database is achieved through CSV files, which can be easily edited in any local desktop spreadsheet program. All aspects of reminder E-Mails may be customized through this interface.
